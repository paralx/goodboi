	<li>Various animal themed Facebook pages were the inspiration behind this website.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Embedded media from various sources such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube videos</li>

</ul>

<h3>Usability</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Clear navigation</li>
	<li>Readable and accessible content</li>
	<li>Responsive design for usability on different devices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I had to do an extensive research to find the best way to extract data from the internet. Web scrapping seemed the best choice, but eventually I decided to go for a simplified approach, pulling some news manually and saving them on a json file.</li>
	<li>HTML and CSS - I had to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to customize the site's layout and design for all devices.</li>
	<li>I had to learn API implementation, form design and email confirmation settings at app.getresponse.com</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evaluation I</h3>
<p>I think the design and layout of the GoodBoi website are particularly successful. The site's clean design, along with its easy-to-navigate layout, make it simple for users to access information. The site's content is also well-organized and entertaining, providing interesting information for animal-lovers.</p>

<h3>Evaluation II</h3>
<p>One aspect of the GoodBoi website that could be improved is the site's loading speed. I need to optimize the site's images and content to improve performance and provide a better user experience.</p>
<p>Another area for improvement is the site's interactivity, with the inclusion of features such as a comment section or user-generated content to increase engagement.</p>
<p>Also, the way data is being pulled could be optimized. I read about web scrapping, API services from other websites that allow me to extract the latest news and post formatting.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of frameworks and a server side for a completed website would be ideal to make it fully functionable.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Facebook</li>
    <li>Youtube</li>
    <li>Twitter</li>
